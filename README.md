# Advent of Code 2022

I started in Ruby, then decided to try it in Go which was a great idea for the learnings. (Not sure what I'll finish in)

Running bash in the Go container
```
  docker compose run --rm go
```

## Conclusions

1. Navigating Go documentation is... interesting. Most of the top google hits are some dude's blog that has been made to look official. Lots of syntactic sugar does not seem to be documented anywhere.
