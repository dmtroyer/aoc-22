## Algorithm ideas

### Decision Tree

1. Nodes with prev, N, E, S, W
2. Traverse matrix prioritizing direction, can only choose those with elevation +-1, on the map and haven't been to yet
3. Stops when no available choices OR makes it to Antenna
  1. When antenna count how many steps
  2. For either, go back up the tree to find other pathways until we make it back to start with no possible choices

### Recursion without tree

1. Start at starting point
2. recurse all possible choices
3. If one of the choices is Antenna, add number of steps to array, return
4. If no possible choices, return

### BFS

 1  procedure BFS(G, root) is
 2      let Q be a queue
 3      label root as explored
 4      Q.enqueue(root)
 5      while Q is not empty do
 6          v := Q.dequeue()
 7          if v is the goal then
 8              return v
 9          for all edges from v to w in G.adjacentEdges(v) do
10              if w is not labeled as explored then
11                  label w as explored
12                  w.parent := v
13                  Q.enqueue(w)
